Provides continuous Player/Tribe structure protection by Tier.
Tier is determined by what engrams have been unlocked by all players in the tribe.

Tier Protection Rules

There are 5 Tiers (default config below):
Thatch
Stone - the stone foundation is unlocked
Metal - the metal foundation is unlocked
Partial-Tek - at least one is unlocked: Tek Replicator, Tek Turret and Tek Shield
Full-Tek - all are unlocked: Tek Replicator, Tek Turret and Tek Shield
Structures that have decayed completely or are longer than 7 days decayed are not subject to Tiering Protection rules and can be attacked normally.
Players can only raid other players/tribes from their own tier.
Higher tier players cannot attack lower tiers players.
Lower tier players can choose to attack higher tiers if they want (after being warned)
If they do, they will become the Tier level of the tribe they are attacking and can be attacked back by that tribe only
Ability to set limits on how long players can stay protected in a specific Tier.

Example Scenario:
Tribe A: is Stone Tier
Tribe B: is Metal Tier
Tribe C: is Stone Tier

- Tribe A, B and tribe C cannot attack Thatch tier.
- Tribe B cannot attack Tribe A or C
- Tribe A can attack tribe C.

- Tribe A cannot attack Tribe B unless they choose too.
Then they will become Stone tier against Tribe B only, and Tribe B can now attack them back.
Tribe A will still be able to attack Tribe C because they are still both considered Stone Tier.

Please note: If this plugin is deployed in the middle of a season then all tribes are defaulted to thatch tier until they log in the map at least once. So, if you happen to attack a tribe that you know is Metal tier but they haven't logged in yet since the upgrade, they will be considered thatch and you wont be able to attack them yet. This is because the plugin reads the tier information from the player character, so they need to log in at least once for that to happen.

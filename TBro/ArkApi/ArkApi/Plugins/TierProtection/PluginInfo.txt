##What's new in version 1.31
hotfix for a logic error discovered when evaluating tribe ids. No other changes.
版本1.31中的新增功能
在评估部落ID时发现的逻辑错误的修补程序。没有其他改变。

##What's new in version 1.3
Added full cluster support with MySQL integration
Fixed bug with the NPC in Genesis missions being protected in Thatch tier :ROFLMAO:
Fixed bug with tribes tiering up and "resetting" the lower attack overrides, when EnableLowToAttackHigh=true. Now when lower tiers attack higher tiers, the two tribes can battle anytime thereafter.
Added NewTierProtectionDurationInDays - this temporary protection you get once you have tiered up. This is to protect you from immediate attacks from any tribes that may have been waiting to attack you the moment you tier up. New tier protection also protects you from lower tier attacks.
Added ProtectedTribeIds to configure full time protection for admin stuff etc..
Improved performance overall.

The config file has been updated.
Also if you are not going to use MySQL then you should remove your database files, because the database schema has changed.
版本1.3中的新功能

使用MySQL Integration添加完整的群集支持

固定在Genesis任务中的NPC中的错误被保护在茅草层中

修复了带有部落的错误分层和“重置”较低攻击覆盖，当EnableLowtoAttackhigh = True时。现在，当较低的层次攻击更高的层时，两条部落可以随时争斗。

添加了newtierprotectionDurationIndays - 这次临时保护一旦您入分层。这是为了保护您免受任何可能一直在等待攻击您的部落的立即攻击。新的层保护还可以保护您免受较低的层次攻击。

添加了ProtectedTribeIds以配置管理员的全日制保护等。

完全提高性能。

配置文件已更新。

此外，如果您不会使用MySQL，那么您应该删除数据库文件，因为数据库模式已更改。



Provides continuous Player/Tribe structure protection by Tier.
Tier is determined by what engrams have been unlocked by all players in the tribe.

Tier Protection Rules

There are 5 Tiers (default config below):
Thatch
Stone - the stone foundation is unlocked
Metal - the metal foundation is unlocked
Partial-Tek - at least one is unlocked: Tek Replicator, Tek Turret and Tek Shield
Full-Tek - all are unlocked: Tek Replicator, Tek Turret and Tek Shield
Structures that have decayed completely or are longer than 7 days decayed are not subject to Tiering Protection rules and can be attacked normally.
Players can only raid other players/tribes from their own tier.
Higher tier players cannot attack lower tiers players.
Lower tier players can choose to attack higher tiers if they want (after being warned)
If they do, they will become the Tier level of the tribe they are attacking and can be attacked back by that tribe only
Ability to set limits on how long players can stay protected in a specific Tier.

Example Scenario:
Tribe A: is Stone Tier
Tribe B: is Metal Tier
Tribe C: is Stone Tier

- Tribe A, B and tribe C cannot attack Thatch tier.
- Tribe B cannot attack Tribe A or C
- Tribe A can attack tribe C.

- Tribe A cannot attack Tribe B unless they choose too.
Then they will become Stone tier against Tribe B only, and Tribe B can now attack them back.
Tribe A will still be able to attack Tribe C because they are still both considered Stone Tier.

Please note: If this plugin is deployed in the middle of a season then all tribes are defaulted to thatch tier until they log in the map at least once. So, if you happen to attack a tribe that you know is Metal tier but they haven't logged in yet since the upgrade, they will be considered thatch and you wont be able to attack them yet. This is because the plugin reads the tier information from the player character, so they need to log in at least once for that to happen.
